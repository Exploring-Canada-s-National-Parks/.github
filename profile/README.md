## What makes Canada's National Parks so unique?

The National Parks of Canada offer much more than picturesque beauty; they let one glimpse through ecological and cultural histories.

The aboriginal wilderness beauty seemed to worship the sacred nature in places like Banff, Jasper, and Pacific Rim National Parks such that no interaction between man and nature was ever allowed therein. Whereas if it fades away from memory, the towering forests will keep the memory alive of sitting by the lake and overwhelmed by what the mountain had to offer. Shall I take this up a notch?
